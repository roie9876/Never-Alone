## 📝 Writing Guidelines

### Style & Tone:
- **Clear and concise** — Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- **Action-oriented** — Use active voice ("The AI detects..." not "Detection is performed...")
- **Empathetic** — Remember, this is about helping vulnerable people
- **Professional** — Suitable for investors, partners, and team members

### Structure:
- **Start with overview** — What is this document about?
- **Use headers** — Break content into scannable sections
- **Add examples** — Concrete examples help understanding
- **End with next steps** — What should the reader do next?

### Markdown Formatting:
```markdown
# Main Title (H1) — Use once per document

## Section (H2) — Major sections

### Subsection (H3) — Details within sections

- Bullet lists for items
- Use ✅ for positive items
- Use ❌ for negative items
- Use ⚠️ for warnings

**Bold** for emphasis
*Italic* for quotes or definitions

[Links](./relative-path.md) use relative paths

`Code` or commands in backticks

```code blocks
Use triple backticks with language
```

| Tables | Are | Useful |
|--------|-----|--------|
| For | Structured | Data |
```
