# 🌙 Never Alone — Executive Summary

> *A gentle AI companion for dementia, aging, and the quiet disease we call loneliness.*

---

## The Problem

**Loneliness is a silent epidemic:**
- **300M+ adults worldwide** experience chronic loneliness
- **14M+ seniors in the U.S.** live alone
- **6.7M Americans** live with Alzheimer's/dementia
- Loneliness increases mortality risk by **26%** (comparable to smoking)
- Family caregivers are overwhelmed, living far away, and need support

**Current solutions fall short:**
- Generic voice assistants (Alexa, Siri) aren't designed for elderly or cognitively impaired
- Physical robots (ElliQ) are expensive ($250 device + $30/month) and limited
- Care homes are understaffed and can't provide emotional companionship at scale

---

3. **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Dashboard** — Remote visibility, photo uploads, reminder management, peace of mind
4. **🌍 Multilingual** — Hebrew & English at launch (others to follow)
5. **📱 No Hardware Required** — Works on existing tablets (iPad, Android)
6. **💰 Affordable** — $19.99/month (vs. ElliQ's $30+ and hardware cost)

### Core Features:
- Real-time voice conversation powered by GPT-5
- Medication, meal, and appointment reminders
