#### Example Interaction:
```
User: "Hey Nora, I'm feeling a bit down today."
AI: "I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about what's on your mind? 
     Sometimes it helps to share."
User: "I just miss my daughter. She's so busy."
AI: "That must be hard. You mentioned last week she's working on a big project. 
     Have you thought about sending her a quick message? Sometimes a simple 
     'thinking of you' can brighten both of your days."
```
